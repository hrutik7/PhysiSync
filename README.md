## üìå Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 1 ‚Äì Weave AI magic with Groq**

---

## üéØ Objective
Now-a-days , Due to long sitting hours Lower back pain and neck pain is becoming very common which may lead to some serious issues like slip disk üíÄ

so patient visit physiotherapy clinics .
Most patients abandon physiotherapy once the pain reduces, leading to frequent relapses and ineffective recovery. Clinics lack real-time tools to guide, monitor, and motivate patients beyond appointments.

What It Solves:

‚úÖ Eliminates manual data entry with real-time transcription during diagnosis.

‚úÖ Converts doctor‚Äôs advice into digital, personalized care plans.

‚úÖ Sends WhatsApp reminders to ensure patients follow through.

‚úÖ Offers a 24/7 virtual physiotherapist for ongoing support and correction.

‚úÖ Reduces relapses and boosts clinic efficiency through intelligent automation.

In short: It turns passive recovery into active healing ‚Äî continuously, personally, and intelligently.

### Your Approach:  

### Why We Chose This Problem

We noticed a recurring pattern in physiotherapy ‚Äî patients often stop their rehab midway once the pain reduces. This leads to relapses, wasted clinic effort, and incomplete recovery. Simultaneously, physiotherapists spend too much time on manual data entry during appointments instead of focusing on the patient. We saw an opportunity to reimagine the physio experience using voice, AI, and automation.

### Key Challenges We Addressed

- Eliminating manual SOAP note-taking via real-time voice transcription (using Whisper + Groq).

- Building a virtual physiotherapy assistant that guides and corrects posture using MediaPipe.

- Delivering WhatsApp-based care reminders for patients post-visit.

- Creating a personalized care flow without needing the physio to touch a computer.

- Making sure it's HIPAA-compliant and encrypted by design.

### Pivots, Brainstorms & Breakthroughs

- Initially, we tried sensor-based posture correction, but quickly pivoted to MediaPipe due to accessibility and scalability.

- Realized that transcription accuracy was key ‚Äî we moved to Groq‚Äôs ultra-fast inference with Whisper, which significantly improved speed and usability.

- Focused on reducing patient dropouts by introducing gamified, scheduled stretches and clinic-branded AI assistants.

Used voice-first design so physiotherapists can focus on healing, not screens.
